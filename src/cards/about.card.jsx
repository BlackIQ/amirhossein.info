      I’m a multi-disciplinary Software Engineer and DevOps Specialist with a
      proven track record of building robust systems from the ground up. Over
      the past several years, I’ve taken on roles ranging from backend developer
      to technical manager, co-founder, and CTO, leading both product
      development and infrastructure design across startups and large
      organizations. At OpenHubble, where I serve as Founder and CEO, I oversee
      everything from code to cloud — combining full-stack engineering with
      DevOps, security, and team leadership. I bring a product-driven mindset, a
      deep technical toolkit, and the ability to guide engineering teams toward
      scalable, secure, and maintainable solutions.
