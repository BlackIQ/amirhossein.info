      I&apos;m a multi-disciplinary Software Engineer and DevOps Specialist with
      a proven track record of building robust systems from the ground up. Over
      the past several years, I&apos;ve taken on roles ranging from backend
      developer to technical manager, co-founder, and CTO, leading both product
      development and infrastructure design across startups and large
      organizations. At OpenHubble, as Founder and CEO, I oversee everything
      from code to cloudâ€”combining full-stack engineering with DevOps, security,
      and team leadership. I bring a product-driven mindset, a deep technical
      toolkit, and the ability to guide engineering teams toward scalable,
      secure, and maintainable solutions.
